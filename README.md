The Match-Winning Pressure Index project addresses a crucial gap in cricket analysis: understanding how players perform in high-pressure situations. Traditional stats like runs and wickets often fail to reflect a player's ability to deliver when it matters most, such as during tight chases or crucial match moments. This project quantifies pressure performance, providing a Pressure Index based on metrics like runs scored or wickets taken in critical scenarios, like the final overs or key moments in a match.

By analyzing historical data and identifying players who thrive under pressure, this model offers actionable insights for teams, coaches, and fantasy players. For teams, it helps identify match-winners who are best suited for high-pressure roles, while fantasy managers can use the index to optimize captain and vice-captain selections during crunch moments.

The results from this project revealed key players like Dwayne Bravo and Hardik Pandya as consistent pressure performers, while highlighting players who tend to underperform in tense situations. Overall, the Pressure Index is a game-changing tool for improving match strategies, player selections, and fantasy team optimization, making it a valuable resource for cricket analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts alike.
